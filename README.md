# SpaceX Falcon 9 Landing Prediction – IBM Data Science Capstone

This repository contains the complete end-to-end implementation of the IBM Data Science Capstone Project.

The objective of this project is to analyze historical SpaceX Falcon 9 launch data and build machine learning models to predict whether the first-stage booster will successfully land after launch. Booster recovery is a key factor in reducing launch costs and improving operational efficiency.

The project follows a full data science lifecycle including data collection, data wrangling, exploratory data analysis, SQL-based analysis, interactive visual analytics using Folium and Plotly Dash, and predictive modeling using multiple classification algorithms.

## Tools & Technologies Used
- Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
- SQL
- Scikit-learn
- Folium (interactive maps)
- Plotly Dash (interactive dashboard)
- Jupyter Notebook

## Repository Structure
- notebooks/ : Data collection, wrangling, EDA, SQL analysis, and machine learning notebooks
- dashboard/ : Plotly Dash application source code
- data/ : Supporting datasets
